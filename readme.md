# Readme Engine

## Description

This is a generator that, using the command line, creates high quality readme files in markdown language efficiently.
The motivation behind this project was to save time coding by automating a trivial task in future projects.
By using this readme generator, you can create a framework for a readme.md in your command line with a few simple questions answered.

## Installation

To use this application, clone the repository to your local computer.

## Usage

1. Open the file path to the parent directory in your terminal.
2. Enter the command 'node index.js' to start the app.
3. Answer the questions and enjoy! When you are done, the readme produce will end up in the 'finalProduct' folder.
4. Move your readmes generated anywhere you want to, for all your projects.

NOTE: every readme produced by the generator will have the same 'readme.md' file name and will always save to the same location unless coded otherwise. If you have a readme in the 'finalProduct' folder you want to keep, you must move and/or copy it to another location or it will be overwritten and lost.
